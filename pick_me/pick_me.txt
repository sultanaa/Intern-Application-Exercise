Hello!
Since it's a not a formal type of thing. My name is Sultan, my personal philosophy is do what you like and enjoy
doing, since I was an in high school I liked web development and programming in general, so when I got into college
I worked part time in an ecommerce startup company to learn and have a real life experience. I found myself in this
field so I continued improving myself and did projects and freelance along the way. Then I decided that I need more, so
I went grad school to gain more knowledge.Recently I developed an app for both Apple and Android stores
called “Metro LA Live”. Finally, getting an internship after school is a good experience for starting the
next step into my career.
